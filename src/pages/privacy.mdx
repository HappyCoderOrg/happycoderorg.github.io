### **Privacy Policy for HappyCoder**

**Effective Date:** February 7, 2026

HappyCoder ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how HappyCoder | AI Prompt Manager & Knowledge Library collects, uses, and safeguards your information when you use our Chrome Extension.

#### **1. Data Collection and Usage**

HappyCoder is designed with a **privacy-first** approach.

- **Personal Information:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, or contact details.
- **Prompt Data:** All prompts you save, create, or organize are stored **locally** in your browser’s storage. We do not have access to your private prompt library.
- **Usage Data:** We do not track your browsing history or monitor your activities on websites, except for the specific purpose of providing prompt management functions (e.g., inserting text into AI chat fields at your request).

#### **2. Permissions and Their Purpose**

To provide its core features, HappyCoder requires the following permissions:

- **Storage:** To save your prompts and settings locally on your device.
- **ActiveTab & Scripting:** To allow you to insert prompts directly into the input fields of AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.
- **ContextMenus:** To enable the "Right-Click to Save" feature from any webpage.
- **Notifications:** To notify you when a prompt has been successfully saved or copied.

#### **3. Data Security and Third-Party Sharing**

- **No Data Selling:** We strictly do not sell, trade, or rent user data to third parties.
- **No Remote Servers:** Since all data is stored locally within your browser, your information never leaves your device and is not uploaded to our servers.
- **No Third-Party Analytics:** We do not use third-party tracking or analytics scripts within the extension.

#### **4. Your Control**

You have full control over your data. You can edit, delete, or clear all stored prompts at any time through the extension’s interface. If you uninstall the extension, all locally stored data associated with HappyCoder will be removed by the browser.

#### **5. Compliance with Chrome Web Store Policies**

HappyCoder complies with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. We ensure that our use of permissions is strictly limited to providing and improving the single purpose of the extension: AI prompt management.
